# Plant Disease Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting plant diseases using deep learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained to classify plant leaves into diseased or healthy categories based on image data.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. These images are preprocessed and fed into the model for training.

## Model Training
The model was trained using a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers, batch normalization, and dropout for regularization.

### Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
2. **Model Training:** Using a CNN with ReLU activation and Softmax output.
3. **Evaluation:** Checking accuracy and loss using validation data.
4. **Testing:** Running predictions on test images.

## Model Performance
| Model  | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|
| CNN    | 98.34%           | 96.3%             |
